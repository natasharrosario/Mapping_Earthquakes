# Mapping Earthquakes
## Creating interactive maps to display earthquake data

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

Additionally, earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, as well as earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5, is displayed across three different maps, as shown below.
